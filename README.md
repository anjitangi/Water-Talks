# Water-Talks

The overarching objective is to explore how the community can become more attuned to environmental changes in natural bodies of water, aiming to prevent ecological catastrophe. Establishing a thoughtful connection between the community and these bodies of water can inspire various methods of attentiveness, including cultural practices and scientific methodologies. The initial step involves delving into the data collection of the Wallkill River to comprehend when this community link was disrupted, with the aspiration of fostering introspection for the viewer. The timeline for the research outlined above spans a complete semester, requiring 15 weeks to implement, execute, and present. The project will culminate in a presentation featuring frequencies generated by a neural network, aiming to capture the essence of the river's voice through both visual and auditory design, exploring the language of water.

## Process
The first phase of this project involves a public exhibition of the findings to complete the metaphor of finding new ways of communicating with water; with data-driven audio-visual explorations. This exploration aims to create a space for contemplation, inviting both the river and ourselves into a dialogue for potential solutions. Rather than providing a definitive answer, this form of presentation encourages self-reflection on possible solutions. The methodology uses computer vision techniques to dive into the nuances of the Wallkill River. It aims to enhance the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) framework for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The study focuses on using the Fourier space to model complex fluid dynamics using video data as input to predict fluid behavior.

**Enhancing Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations**

*Data Collection and Preprocessing*
The first phase involves identifying and acquiring relevant video datasets, including fluid dynamics scenarios. Preprocessing steps will be implemented using OpenCV to extract optical flow vectors, enhance contrast, and apply thresholding. Frames will be cropped to focus on regions of interest and convert flow fields into PyTorch tensors. 

*Model Architecture Enhancement*
Enhancing the model architecture will involve developing a more robust downsampling CNN to better handle high-resolution video frames while maintaining the integrity of spatial information. Additional Fourier layers will be implemented to capture higher-order spectral information, experimenting with different modes. Advanced linear transformations will be integrated to improve local spatial data retention. This phase is estimated to take around three weeks.

*Training Optimization*
Optimizing the training process includes standardizing and normalizing input data and labels to ensure consistent training performance. Different loss functions and optimizers will be experimented with to improve model convergence and reduce training time. Advanced techniques such as mixed precision training and gradient accumulation will be utilized to manage memory usage and accelerate training.

*Comprehensive Evaluation*
The evaluation phase involves validating the model on unseen data, comparing predictions against ground truth labels using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Visualizations, including heatmaps and vector field animations, will be generated to qualitatively assess model performance. Results will be compiled and analyzed to identify strengths, limitations, and areas for further improvement. 

*Incorporation into Graphic Simulation*
The final phase will focus on integrating the enhanced FNO model into a graphic simulation. This will involve creating a visual representation of fluid dynamics based on the modelâ€™s predictions, providing an interactive and immersive way to observe and analyze the behavior of fluid systems.
