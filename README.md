# Water-Talks

The overarching objective is to explore how the community can become more attuned to environmental changes in natural bodies of water, aiming to prevent ecological catastrophe. Establishing a thoughtful connection between the community and these bodies of water can inspire various methods of attentiveness, including cultural practices and scientific methodologies. The initial step involves delving into the data collection of the Wallkill River to comprehend when this community link was disrupted, with the aspiration of fostering introspection for the viewer. The timeline for the research outlined above spans a complete semester, requiring 15 weeks to implement, execute, and present. The project will culminate in a presentation featuring frequencies generated by a neural network, aiming to capture the essence of the river's voice through both visual and auditory design, exploring the language of water.

## Process
The first phase of this project involves a public exhibition of the findings to complete the metaphor of finding new ways of communicating with water; with data-driven audio-visual explorations. This exploration aims to create a space for contemplation, inviting both the river and ourselves into a dialogue for potential solutions. Rather than providing a definitive answer, this form of presentation encourages self-reflection on possible solutions. The methodology uses computer vision techniques to dive into the nuances of the Wallkill River.

*Visual Frequency Extraction*: Employ image processing techniques, including masking, edge detection, background subtraction, and movement detection, to isolate and extract the visual frequency patterns of waves as they traverse the frame.

*Audio Synthesis from Visual Data*: Utilize mathematical tools such as Fourier Transforms, coupled with frequency and amplitude measurements, to convert the isolated visual wave patterns into corresponding audio representations. This will translate the visual dynamics of water into an auditory experience, where different movements within the water produce distinct sounds, with varying frequencies and stress levels.

*Self-Organizing Neural Network*: Develop a self-classifying neural network trained to categorize and understand different classifications of wave videos. This network will learn to recognize and differentiate the characteristics of various wave types, allowing for the creation of a subjective system of labels.

*Language of Water*: Establish a unique language derived from the water, where the audio-visual pieces generated through the project serve as symbols or expressions, akin to words in a language. The goal is to develop an exhibition of the abstract patterns and rhythms of water that contribute to a narrative of resilience and communication between the community and its natural resources. 

I want to find out what ways the community can be attentive towards environmental changes to natural bodies of water, with the hopes of preventing ecological catastrophe. A thoughtful connection between the community and these bodies of water encourages a myriad of ways of being attentive to these changes, including cultural practices and scientific methodologies. I will start by exploring the data collection of the Wallkill River and try to understand when this community link was broken, in hopes of healing this bond and fostering new ways of communicating with the river. That’s why it’s important to engage with the community in a public demonstration of these findings through various audio-visual techniques.
